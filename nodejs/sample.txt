My presence sweet and my aura bright
Diamonds good for my appetite
Guess it fuckin' just clicked one night
All them demons helped me see shit differently
So don't be sad for me

How you been spending your time? (Huh)
How you be using your tongue? (Huh)
You be so worried 'bout mine (Huh)
Can't even get yourself none

You know you sound so dumb (So dumb, so dumb)
You know you sound so dumb (So dumb)

So maybe you should shut up
Hmm, yeah, maybe you should shut up
Said, if only you would shut up
Uh, yeah, that's right, you should shut up

I vibrate high and my circle lit
We ain't really with drugs and shit
Love the game so I never miss
Keep opinions muted for the hell of it
'Cause I like my shit

How you been spending your time? (Huh)
How you be using your tongue? (Huh)
You be so worried 'bout mine (Huh)
Can't even get yourself none
